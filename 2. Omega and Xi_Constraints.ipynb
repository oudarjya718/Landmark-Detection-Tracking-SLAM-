The matrix is square and labelled with all the robot poses (xi) and all the landmarks (Li). Every time you make an observation, for example, as you move between two poses by some distance `dx` and can relate those two positions, you can represent this as a numerical relationship in these matrices.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"BAeyLHYScDQ-","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","# define omega and xi as in the example\n","omega = np.array([[1,0,0],\n","                  [-1,1,0],\n","                  [0,-1,1]])\n","\n","xi = np.array([[-3],\n","               [5],\n","               [3]])\n","\n","# calculate the inverse of omega\n","omega_inv = np.linalg.inv(np.matrix(omega))\n","\n","# calculate the solution, mu\n","mu = omega_inv*xi\n","\n","# print out the values of mu (x0, x1, x2)\n","print(mu)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GN4GSjcccKPs","colab_type":"text"},"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Fj8KKxI9cHJM","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"srZhMKqbcHKl","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hwjVf8occHOj","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
